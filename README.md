# Spotify-project
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to my Spotify Clone project â€” a sleek and modern recreation of Spotifyâ€™s web interface, built entirely with HTML and CSS.  I created this project to practice front-end skills, experiment with layouts, and explore how to bring real-world UI designs to life with clean code.
